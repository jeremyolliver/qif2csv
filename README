Qif2csv
=======

Qif2csv is a tool for converting .qif files to .csv for Mac OS X
qif files are commonly used by financial applications for exporting transactional data,
I didn't find any free converters for mac, so I wrote one using HotCocoa

Installation
============
This application requires MacRuby to run. MacRuby is free from http://www.macruby.org/
once that's installed, simply copy the .app bundled here to your Applications directory
