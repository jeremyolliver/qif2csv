Qif2csv
=======

Qif2csv is a tool for converting .qif files to .csv for Mac OS X
qif files are commonly used by financial applications for exporting transactional data,
I didn't find any free converters for mac, so I wrote one myself using HotCocoa

Installation
============
Simply copy Qif2csv.app into your applications folder and run it

About
=====
This is written using MacRuby (http://www.macruby.org) 0.4 and HotCocoa. MacRuby is bundled as a framework inside the application,
so you don't need to install it to run the application.
